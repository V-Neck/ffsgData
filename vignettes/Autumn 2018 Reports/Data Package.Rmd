# Progress Made in 2018
I've taken important steps this quarter towards making `ffsgData` a package
which contains

1. Scraping
2. Harmonization
3. Merging & Imputation

I added R Oxygen comments to the scraping and harmonization modules, and 
rearranged the files in a style which is consistent with R packages. A example
of this work can be viewed [here](https://github.com/statnet/ffsg/blob/1d7d3450b130964676f2f747088a71c197678638/Data/ffsgData/R/Harmonizer.R#L1).

# Intentions for 2019
I would like to finish the doumentation process, and produce a legitimate R
package which covers scraping and harmonization, without yet handling merging
or imputation.
